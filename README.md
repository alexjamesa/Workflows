# Workflows
A command line utility to quickly search and display text files in Terminal. *Workflows* works with any .txt files, but it's specially made for those files with a title on the top line and list of tags on the bottom line‚Äîsee below for an example. Written in Python 2.7 with unit and integration tests.

### Example *Workflows* text file

	Creating a workflow text file
	
	1. Open up Sublime Text
	2. Add the workflow name to the top line
	3. Enter in the workflow steps on subsequent lines
	4. On the bottom line, add relevant tags in the format "Tags: workflow, steps, how-to"
	5. Save the file as <anything>.txt
	
	Tags: workflow, steps, how-to, meta

### Example usage
To return a list of text files in *TestWorkflows* that have "git" and "commit" in the name (i.e., the top line of the file):
		
	python Workflows.py TestWorkflows -n git commit 
	
To return a list of text files in *TestWorkflows* that have "git" in the name and a "workflow" tag:
		
	python Workflows.py TestWorkflows -n git -t workflow

All directories within *TestWorkflows* will be searched in both cases. The names of all matching files will then be presented as a menu. Select a file to print it directly into your Terminal window. üëèüèº

### Options
* -n: name keywords
* -b: body keywords
* -t: tag keywords
* -w: wild keywords *(i.e., can appear anywhere)*
* -s: smart keywords *(can be anywhere, but matches in the name are weighted highest and matches in the body are weighted lowest)*

### Notes
Consider adding the following line to your `.bash_profile` file (Mac) for easy access to *Workflows*:

	alias wf="python ~/'path to/Workflows.py' ~/'where you/keep your/Workflows'"

Then using *Workflows* can be as simple as this: `wf -n git commit`
